<h3>Artificial intelligence (AI):</h3><h4> the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled 
robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings,</h4> 
<h4>for example, discovering 
proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chessâ€”with great proficiency.</h4>

<h4>All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated
insect behaviour is never taken as an indication of intelligence.</h4>  

<h4> On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals 
in performing certain specific tasks,</h4>
<h4>so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense
is found in applications as diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.</h4>
